# TeXHelp
TeXHelp is a MacOS application that provides a user-friendly interface to the comprehensive help documents packaged with TeXLive:

TeXHelp can also index all the pdf files in the TeXLive documentation, to try to identify individual LaTeX commands that are used in each document. This means that searches within TeXHelp can look for individual LaTeX commands, as well as the pdf title and the accompanying TeXLive package information:

However, it can take TeXHelp a few hours to index the database when first installed.
